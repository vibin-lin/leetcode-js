Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in place and return the new length.


Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.


Example:
Given input array nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3


Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

在一个数组中移除制定值, 返回新数组长度, 不能新建一个数组

例：
给定输入数组nums = [3,2,2,3]，val = 3
你的函数应该返回length = 2，num的前两个元素是2。
